# Parasol
Parasol is a cross-platform CLI File explorer inspired by Vim commands, designed to be minimal and fully keyboard-centric. Unlike most file explorers, Parasol does not use the arrow keys for navigation, instead each file and directory is assigned a number and you can operate with the files and paths through their numbers.
