# Parasol
Parasol is a cross-platform TUI File designed to be minimal. Unlike most TUI file explorers, Parasol does not use the arrow keys for navigation, instead each file and directory is assigned a number and you can interact with the files and paths through their numbers.

This project was also a headstart to learn Java and Go, so while it's now developed in Java, the legacy Go code is kept in the old folder.

More features will come in future versions
